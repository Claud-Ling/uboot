Bootloder for AVR

WHAT IS GOING 2 B IMPLEMENTED
Xmodem function with CRC checking
LED indication of each packet
Watchdog if nothing is going on
Check every 128 bytes received, and write in flash if the content is different
LED indication of succesfully received firmware
Led indication for waiting time for incoming firmware
Do not write 1A bytes in the end of the last packet
Check the duplication of <CR> coming from the ARM side

Algorithm for flashing firmware
1. Waiting for 1-2 sec when all the odd data from ARM side will come out and will be ignored (Show by LED)
2. If "$U" - command existed in odd data  - allow to start firmware update.
